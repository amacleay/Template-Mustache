Template::Mustache
==================

Template::Mustache is a port of the [Mustache](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache) templating language to Perl.

The docs are presently pretty sparse (really, this is about it), but this is a functional representation of the spec.

To do development work on this project, you will also need (at the very least) [Test::Mini::Unit](http://github.com/pvande/Test-Mini-Unit).

This project is subject to ongoing development.
